# 9 - `POST`ing data to express

- We have seen how to pass data to an express app with `GET` via URL params and URL routes ...
- now let's see how to send data to express via `POST`

## I. Get Started
- Duplicate the entire **router-app-passing-params** folder and re-name the copy to **router-app-POST**
  - you might want to delete the **node_modules** folder before you make the copy; if so, don't forget to `npm i` below
- Open up **router-app-POST** in VSCode and `npm i`,  `npm run dev`
- Verify that the app's endpoints still work in the browser

# 2 - Heroku Test

## I. Fork the test repository

- Head to https://github.com/tonethar/HerokuTest and **Fork** your own copy of it
  - keep the fork you made open in a web brpwser tab, or copy the URL for later
  - you don't need to clone to your desktop yet
- Look at the source code of your new repository - it is a simple web server that will echo "Hello!" to the browser
- Note the "start" script in **package.json** - this is what Heroku will run after it has downloaded all of the required packages from npm

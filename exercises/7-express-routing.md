# 7 - Express Routing

## Overview
- *Routing* refers to determining how an application responds to a client request for a particular endpoint
- *Routing libraries* make it easy to organize your app's *routes* - for example `/home`, `/quotes`, `/quotes/id`, `quotes/random`, `quotes/random/5` etc
- We are going to re-architect **first-express-app** to use a routing library

---

## I. Get Started
- Duplicate the entire **first-express-app** folder and re-name the copy to **first-routing-app**
  - you might want to delete the **node_modules** folder before you make the copy; if so, don't forget to `npm i`
- Open up **first-routing-app** in VSCode and `npm i` . `npm run dev` and verify that the app still works in the browser

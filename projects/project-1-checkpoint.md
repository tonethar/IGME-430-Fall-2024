# Project 1 - Checkpoint

## I. Get Started
- Complete the express HW up to and including [14 - Finish up the hoot admin page](../exercises/14-finish-up-hoot-admin.md)
- Duplicate the entire **router-app-POST** folder and re-name the copy to **p1-430-&lt;abc1234>** where `abc1234` is your RIT id
- Open the folder in VSCode - them `npm i`, `npm test`, `npm run dev` to be sure that everything still works

## II. Create a Project 1 repo on GitHub
- Overview: You need to create a new project 1 repo on GitHub, and connect your local **p1-430-&lt;abc1234>** repo to it
- This previous exercise will be a good reminder on how to do this --> [9 - Putting our project on Heroku](../exercises/9-putting-project-on-heroku.md)
  - name this new remote repo **p1-430-&lt;abc1234>** and make it empty, and **@--->** ***private*** **&lt;---@** visibility
  - after you have created it, add [`tonethar` (me)](https://github.com/tonethar) as a collaborator so that I can see this repo
  - on the command line, in your local **p1-430-&lt;abc1234>** folder, go ahead and set the `remote` repo to this new project 1 repo you just created, as we did before in Part 9 linked above

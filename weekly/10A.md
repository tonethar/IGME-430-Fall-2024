# Week 10A Notes

## I. Questions from last time?

---

 - BTW - how can we completely "uninstall" packages we no longer need - like [**body-parser**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)?

---

- Discuss - last time we saw that express throws an exception when HTTP headers are sent at "the wrong time" - why?

---

## II. Today's topic - Server-side rendering with Handlebars
- *SSR is a method where the server generates the HTML and CSS code for a web page and sends it to the client (the user's browser) as a fully rendered page*
- We've actually seen server-side rendering (aka SSR) already - during week 2:
  - [3 - Web services & Query Strings (Demo)](../exercises/3-web-service-query-string.md)
- Nice listing of SSR pros and cons --> https://prismic.io/blog/what-is-ssr

---

## III. About Handlerbars
- Handlebars is a simple *templating* language.
- It uses a *template* and an *input object* to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions:

```js
<p>{{firstname}} {{lastname}}</p>
```

- Reference:
  - https://handlebarsjs.com
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars
  - https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars

## IV. Demo: Server-side rendering with `express` & `express-handlebars`
- [Demo start code for `simple-mvc-templates`](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-mvc-templates) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo

### IV-A. Some Start Code
- Here's some code to get you started in **app.js**

```js
// import handlebars for express
const expressHandlebars = require('express-handlebars');

// Below goes AFTER app.use(express.json());

app.engine('handlebars', expressHandlebars.engine({
  defaultLayout: '',
}));
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
app.set('views', `${__dirname}/../views`);
```


### IV-B. Overview
- If you check out **package.json** you'll see that there is a `express-handlebars` dependency ...
- ... in **app.js** we are importing `express-handlebars`
- And now we have some new express methods to work with `app.engine()` and `app.set()`
- `app.engine()`
  - https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.engine
  - https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars
- `app.set()`
  - https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.set
- Note that the HTML files in the **views/** folder now have a **.handlebars** extension
- **controllers/index.js**
  - this is where most of our new changes are going to be
  - rather than doing `res.sendFile()`, we are going to use handlebars to fill in our templates and send back the result of that operation
  

### IV-C. Look in views/index.handlebars

- Check out the title tag `<title>{{title}}</title>`


### IV-D. controllers/index.js

- Add the following to `hostIndex`

```js
res.render('index', {
  title: 'Home',
});
```

- `res.render()`
  - renders a view and sends the rendered HTML string to the client
  - https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.render

---

- `npm run nodemon` to test the code

---

### IV-E. More for views/index.handlebars

```html
<h1>Welcome to {{pageName}}!</h1>
<p>How are you today, {{userName}}?</p>
```

---

- Now go ahead and pass in a `pageName` and `userName` value

---

### IV-F. And so on

- Let's look at:
  - conditional rendering
  - loops

 ---

### IV-G. Discussion

- What are some *advantages* of server-side rendering?
- And *disadvantages*?
- Nice listing of pros and cons --> https://prismic.io/blog/what-is-ssr
 
---

## V. Demo: More rendering with handlebars - loops & conditionals
- [Demo start code for `simple-template-api`](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-template-api) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo
- This time we have a hard-coded data file of movies
- We will see how to access multiple query string parameters and filter the results****

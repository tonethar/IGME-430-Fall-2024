# Week 10A Notes

## 0. Questions from last time?

---

 - BTW - how can we completely "uninstall" packages we no longer need - like [**body-parser**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)?

---

- Discuss - last time we saw that express throws an exception when HTTP headers are sent at "the wrong time" - why?

---

## I. About Handlerbars
- Handlebars is a simple *templating* language.
- It uses a *template* and an *input object* to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions:

```js
<p>{{firstname}} {{lastname}}</p>
```

- Reference:
  - https://handlebarsjs.com
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars
  - https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars

## II. Server-side rendering with `express` & `express-handlebars`
- [Demo start code for `simple-mvc-templates`](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-mvc-templates) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo
- Here's some code to get you started in **app.js**

```js
// import handlebars for express
const expressHandlebars = require('express-handlebars');

// Below goes AFTER app.use(express.json());

app.engine('handlebars', expressHandlebars.engine({
  defaultLayout: '',
}));
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
app.set('views', `${__dirname}/../views`);
```

---

## III. More rendering with handlebars - loops & conditionals
- [Demo start code for `simple-template-api`](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-template-api) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo

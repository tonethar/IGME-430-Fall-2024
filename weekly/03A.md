# Week 3A

## I. Practice Quiz & HTTP Ref
- [Practice Quiz #1](../assessment/practice-quiz-1.md)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#HTTP/1.1_request_messages
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers

## II. Review **quotes-server**

### Pluses

- "No code/low code" solution easy to spin up
- HTTP methods supported: GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
- Simple searching functionality supported via query string
- Persists changes to JSON file

### Minuses
- Data file must be JSON
- "No code" means that even a simple `/quotes/random` endpoint can't be written
- "No code" means we can't validate any of the submitted quote data on the server-side
- We can only send JSON formatted text to the service, not form URL encoded data, binary data etc
- We were creating and sending a guid and time stamps on the *client*,  and then sending them to the *server* ...
  - BUT normally, the guid and timestamps would be instead be created on the server, NOT on the client

##  III. `first-node` 

- We will begin to explore how to set up an `http` server utilizing NodeJS
  - we won't get too far on this today - will complete it next time!

### Get started

- Create a **first-node** folder somewhere on your desktop
- Open the **first-node** folder up in VSCode
- Open the VSCode terminal - and make sure that the terminal type is *GitBash*
- Type `npm init -y`
- Create an **src** directory
- Create **src/server.js**
- Add `console.log("Hello World")` to the top of **server.js**
- Type `node src/server.js` to check the console for the "Hello World" log
- In **package.json**, replace "test" with a "start" script:
  - `"start": "node src/server.js"`
- Test this by typing `npm start` - you should see the log in the console.

### Keep going
- We will be looking at:
  - serving pages with the built-in `http` library
  - multiple script files
  - importing/exporting scripts

## IV. Homework
- You should have done this already - I'm not collecting it - but if you don't set up GitHub and Heroku properly you're not going to get much further in this class --> [1 - Git & Heroku Setup](../exercises/1-git-and-heroku-setup.md)
- [2 - Heroku Test](../exercises/2-heroku-test.md) - ***it is due start of class next time*** - time allowing I will do a quick demo of this - suggestion: just "watch and learn", don't try to follow along

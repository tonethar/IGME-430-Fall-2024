# Week 3A

## I. Review **quotes-server**

### Pluses

- "no code/low code" solution easy to spin up
- HTTP methods supported: GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
- Simple searching functionality supported via query string
- Persists changes to JSON file

### Minuses
- data file must be JSON
- "no code" means that even a simple `/quotes/random` endpoint can't be written
- "no code" means we can't validate any of the submitted quote data on the server-side
- we can only send JSON formatted text to the service, not form URL encoded data, binary data etc
- we were creating and sending a guid and time stamps on the client,  and then sending them to the serverto the server ...
  - normally, the guid and timestamps would be instead be created on the server, NOT on the client

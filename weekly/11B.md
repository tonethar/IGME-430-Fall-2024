# Week 11B

## I. Review

- Questions about [SimpleModels HW](11A.md#iii-simplemodels-hw)?

## II. DomoMaker A
- This exercise is the first of a 5-part series to build a small MVC-based login system with some basic per-user functionality.
- You will be building a site to make new "Domo" characters and track some basic stats. The user will make an account, login and then name their new character and give them an age.
- Data will be persisted in MongoDB Atlas (the "cloud") and users will be able to login on any computer and see the characters they have created

### II-A. Get Started!

- One thing - want to get rid of these annoying ESLint warnings about console.logs?
  - add `"no-console": "off"` to your **.eslintrc** file

### II-B. All done and working?
- A couple of things to fix in **app.js**:
  - go ahead and uninstall `bodyParser` and modify the code to work without it
  - make it so the web server does not start up until mongo has successfully loaded
  - you need to hide your MongoDB Atlas connection string somewhere, otherwise it will be visible in GitHub! There are 2 ways we could do this.

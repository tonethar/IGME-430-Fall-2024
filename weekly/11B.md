## II. DomoMaker A
- This exercise is the first of a 5-part series to build a small MVC-based login system with some basic per-user functionality.
- You will be building a site to make new "Domo" characters and track some basic stats. The user will make an account, login and then name their new character and give them an age.
- Data will be persisted in MongoDB Atlas (the "cloud") and users will be able to login on any computer and see the characters they have created

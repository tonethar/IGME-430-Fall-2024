# Week 9B Notes

## I. Project 1
- Let's look at some submissions!

---

## II. HW
- See **HTTP MVC & Server Design Worksheet** in myCourses

---

## III. Debugging
- Debugging Demo
  - start files are [here](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/debugging-demo) - just download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm start`, you don't need to fork this repo

---

## IV. Express Review
- [Demo "start code" for `simple-mvc-controllers`](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-mvc-controllers) - just download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo
- Here's some code to get you started in **app.js**

```js
const app = express();
app.use('/assets', express.static(path.resolve(`${__dirname}/../client/`)));
app.use(compression());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(favicon(`${__dirname}/../client/img/favicon.png`));
router(app);

app.listen(port, (err) => {
  if(err){
    throw err;
  }
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

- Some new things in this **app.js**:
  - `app.use(compression())`
    - middleware for express, it compresses most files before they are sent to a client
    - https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/compression.html
  - `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`
    - `extended: true` makes it use the [qs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) for nested query strings
  - `app.use(favicon(`${__dirname}/../client/img/favicon.ico`));`
    - to server a default favicon - npm docs here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-favicon
    - for other favicons, add this to HTML `<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/assets/img/favicon.png">`

# Week 9B Notes

## I. Project 1
- Let's look at some submissions!

---

## II. HW
- See **HTTP MVC & Server Design Worksheet** in myCourses

---

## III. Debugging
- Debugging Demo
  - start files are [here](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/debugging-demo) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm start`, you don't need to fork this repo

---

## IV. Express Review
- [Demo "start code" for `simple-mvc-controllers`](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-mvc-controllers) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo
- Here's some code to get you started in **app.js**

```js
const app = express();
app.use('/assets', express.static(path.resolve(`${__dirname}/../client/`)));
app.use(compression());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(favicon(`${__dirname}/../client/img/favicon.png`));
router(app);

app.listen(port, (err) => {
  if(err){
    throw err;
  }
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

- Some new things in this **app.js**:
  - `app.use(compression())`
    - middleware for express, it compresses most files before they are sent to a client
    - https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/compression.html
  - `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`
    - allows us to easily parse "old school" form data that is urlencoded
    - `extended: true` makes it use the [qs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) for nested query strings
  - **app.use(favicon(\`${__dirname}/../client/img/favicon.png\`));**
    - to server a default favicon - npm docs here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-favicon
    - for other favicons, add this to HTML `<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/assets/img/favicon.png">`
    - SO post on this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15463199/how-to-set-custom-favicon-in-express
  - `router(app);`
    - here we are creating a single instance of `express()` and sending it over to our router
    - this will scale better than how we did it on project 1
- **router.js**
  - add `GET` routes from *specific*, to more *general*
  - add `GET` `/page1` and `/page2` routes that load in `controllers.page1` and `controllers.page2`
  - add a `GET` `/` route that loads `controllers.index`
  - add a `GET` "wildcard" route - `/*`  - that loads `controllers.notFound`
- **controller/index.js**
  - here's `notFound`

```js
const notFound = (req, res) => {
  return res.status(404).sendFile(path.resolve(`${__dirname}/../../views/notFound.html`));
};
```

- And you'll need to add `module.exports = ...`

---

- Now test it, you'll see:
  - all the pages work
  - the 404 page works
  - get and post (the form) for name do not work - we have no handlers
  - the image works, because of static hosting in **app.js**

---

- **controllers/index.js**
  - implement `getName` - which returns `name`
  - implement `setName` - which grabs `req.body.firstname` and `req.body.lastname` that the form sent over
- **router.js**
  - add a `GET` route for `/getName`
  - add a `POST` route for `/setName`

 ---

 - Test it again - `/getName` and `/setName` should now work

---

 - BTW - how can we "uninstall" packages we no longer need - like [**body-parser**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)?

---

## V. Next time
- Server-side rendering with the Handlebars templating engine

  - [YouTube: Rich Media 2 - Week 8.1 Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnUBOLjXVZU)
  - Database Popularity:
    - https://db-engines.com/en/ranking
    - Note that [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) has continued to grow in popularity, while [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is shrinking
    - PostgreSQL is open source, relational, and also has a robust language for querying key:value data

  - Covers the CRUD operations of MongoDB

## III. Mongoose
- https://mongoosejs.com/
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose
- Simple-MVC-Example:
  - Walkthough --> [YouTube: Week 8.2 Simple MVC - Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgCCVpRRbM)
  - Start Code --> [Simple-MVC-Example](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/Simple-MVC-Example) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo
  - Note that unlike what the video is doing, you do not need to install a local version of MongoDB, and can solely use a MongoDB cloud database

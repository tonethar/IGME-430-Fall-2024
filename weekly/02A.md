# Week 2A

# I. Review
- Last time we looked at having our quotes-app hit a PHP *web service* that returned a single random quote
  - The  first PHP script ([quote-random.php](https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/fall-2024/services/quote/quote-random.php)) sent HTTP *response headers* (for CORS and Content-Type)
  - The  second PHP script ([quote-random-json-or-text.php](https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/fall-2024/services/quote/quote-random-json-or-text.php)) also looked at *request headers* (thjose sent by the client) and then sent back content depending on what the value of the `Accept` header was
- In the quote-app code, we saw how to add *request headers* to `XHR` and `fetch()` requests - request headers are one way that a browser can send information (in this case, about the web service call) to a web service
- We also saw how to use [destructured function parameters](https://www.jstips.co/en/javascript/use-destructuring-in-function-parameters/) to make our code more self-documenting
- We also reviewed the use of the Chrome debugger, Chrome Network Inspector tab, and the Postman app

## II. Today's Activities
- Finish up:
  - [2 - Ajax, Web Services, HTTP Headers (Accept & Content-type)](../exercises/2-ajax-web-services-accept-headers.md)
  - ... still need to talk about `ssh`, plus a `telnet` demo of an HTTP request, and a quick look at those `fetch()` and `Promise` notes
- New Stuff
  - [3 - Web services & Query Strings (Demo)](../exercises/3-web-service-query-string.md)
  - ... not too much new here - primarily it's about passing data to a web service using the *query string*, in this case the number of random quotes we want back
    - https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/fall-2024/services/random-jokes.php
    - https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/fall-2024/services/random-jokes.php?limit=5
    - the *query string* is another popular way to pass *parameters* to a web service (remember how we can think of web services as "always-on cloud functions"?
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string
  - [4 - Exploring HTTP methods with json-server](../exercises/4-http-methods-with-json-server.md)

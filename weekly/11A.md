## I. Databases
- Database Presentation:
  -  See *Databases 9.1* PDF in Week 10 of myCourses
  - [YouTube: Rich Media 2 - Week 8.1 Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnUBOLjXVZU)
  - Database Popularity:
    - https://db-engines.com/en/ranking
    - Note that [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) has continued to grow in popularity, while [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is shrinking
    - PostgreSQL is open source, relational, and also has a robust language for querying key:value data
    - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is still popular in the rankings at #5
- HW - Database Worksheet:
  - see myCourses for due date and details

## I. Review MongoDB HW
- [HW - MongoDB - Intro to mongo shell](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-430-Spring-2020/blob/master/notes/mongo-shell-intro.md)
  - Covered the CRUD operations of MongoDB

---

## II. Continue `mongoose` walkthrough
- https://mongoosejs.com/
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose
- Simple-MVC-Example:
  - Walkthough --> [YouTube: Week 8.2 Simple MVC - Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DgCCVpRRbM)
    - note that unlike what the video is doing, you do not need to install a local version of MongoDB, and can solely use a MongoDB cloud database
    - also note that some of the code in the video is deprecated, and the correct code is in "done" version linked below, and in the *9.2 Simple MVC Example.docx* file in myCourses
  - Start Code --> [Simple-MVC-Example](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/Simple-MVC-Example) - just `git clone` or download the ZIP and `npm i` / `npm run nodemon`, you don't need to fork this repo
  - "Done" Code --> [Simple-MVC-Example - Commented "Done" Code](https://github.com/IGM-RichMedia-at-RIT/simple-mvc-example-done)
- Links:
  - https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#Query.prototype.find()
  - https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#Query.prototype.findOne()
  - https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.findOne/
  - https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#Query.prototype.findOneAndUpdate()
  - https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/findoneandupdate.html
  - https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.9/classes/Collection.html#findOneAndUpdate

## III. SimpleModels HW
- Worth 2 HW assignments
- For "start" code, it uses the "Done" version of *Simple-MVC-Example* above

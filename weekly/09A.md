# Week 9A Notes

## I. Project 1
- Due: ***Project 1 - "Back end" checkpoint*** dropbox in myCourses
- Work on [Project 1 Requirements](../projects/project-1.md)

---

## II. Errata
- A small fix to [Express and responding to HEAD requests](../projects/p1-express-HEAD.md#iii-hoots-example)
  - EDIT: replace `const { length } = JSON.stringify(hoots);` (line 81) with:
    - `const length = Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(hoots), 'utf8');`
    - ... in this instance, both lines will return the same number ...
    - ... but `Buffer.byteLength()` will work properly with multi-byte encoded strings
   
---

## III. Work Day
- Finish up Project 1
